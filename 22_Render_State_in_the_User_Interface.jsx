/*
The most important concept about the state is:  if you make a component stateful, no other components are aware of its state. Its state is completely encapsulated, or local to that component, unless you pass state data to a child component as props.

In the code editor, MyComponent is already stateful. Define an h1 tag in the component's render method which renders the value of name from the component's state.

Note: The h1 should only render the value from state and nothing else. In JSX, any code you write with curly braces { } will be treated as JavaScript. So to access the value from state just enclose the reference in curly braces.

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'freeCodeCamp'
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>

      </div>
    );
  }
};

          <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>
